Since almost all documents I have found on the Internet has copyright
forbidding the distribution of them, I have instead made a list of
information about RS-274[XD]. I found them by, basically, using google.

* What's all this about RS274X Anyway?

"If you're a PCB designer you're probably hearing more and more about 
extended Gerber - RS274X. The latest versions of many PCB layout programs 
either offer RS274X as an option or only output RS274X-- such as Cadence's 
Allegro."

Discusses the extension to RS27X from RS274D. Continuation from above.

* Webutils for gerber files
"These web utilities are Java servlets written by C. Scott Ananian; 
the source code is licensed under the GNU GPL."
Send in your gerber and you can view it on the web as SVG. There is
also an Gerber to HPGL converter.
